Microchip Hash Table Filter Entry Calculator ReBuild

Was searching for the original Microchip Hash Table Filter Entry Calculator.exe, couldn't find it. So I've built one of my own.
I've used it for my ENC28J60(+AVR) project.

Some changes:
- added CRC Polynomial field with default value
- added CRC Initial value field with default value
- multiple MAC Address support

Output:
Gives full Hash Table (ETH0-7) result, as well as individual results with CRC32 result, for manual validation of needed.
(Last output line is only for Information is some Hash Table result are the same.)
